# AtliQ-Hospitality-Analysis
## Project Overview
AtliQ Grands owns multiple 5 star hotels across india. They have been in the hospitality industry for the past 20 years. Due to strategic moves from other competitors and ineffective decision-making in management, AtliQ Grands are losing its market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotels category. As a strategic move, the managing director of AtliQ Grands wanted to incorporate “Business and Data Intelligence” to regain their market share and revenue. However, they do not have an in-house data analytics team to provide them with these insights.
## Objective
As a data analyst, the objective was to create dashboards for the revenue management team of AtliQ Grands hotels to provide insights on revenue trend.

## Domain Knowledge
* Average Daily Rate(ADR) - The ADR is useful to measure a property’s financial performance, as well as to compare the hotel’s performance to its competitors.
* Revenue Per Available Room(Revpar) - RevPAR represents the success the hotel is having at filling its rooms. Increasing RevPAR means either that rates or Occupancy Rate are rising, or both.
* Occupancy% - Occupancy rate in hotels is an important KPI for hotel revenue management in order to understand how many of the available rooms are actually being used.
* Daily Sellable Room Nights(DSRN) - The metric serves as a guide to understanding a hotel's dominance and demand in the marketplace.
* Daily Utilized Room Nights(DURN) - Daily utilized room nights are important in the hospitality industry as they directly impact revenue generation, occupancy rates, and overall profitability of a hotel or lodging establishment.
* Daily Booked Room Nights(DBRN) - Daily booked room nights are crucial in hospitality for revenue, occupancy rates, and business performance, guiding pricing strategies and maximizing profitability.
